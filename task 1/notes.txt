In your second code you have used the OpenMP critical construct. 
This is a relatively heavy-weight in comparison with the atomic adds, usually used to implement the reduction at the end. 
Atomic adds on x86 are performed using the LOCK instruction prefix and everything gets implemented in the hardware. 
On the other side, critical sections are implemented using mutexes and require several instructions and often busy waiting loops. 
This is far less efficient than the atomic adds.
